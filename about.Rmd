## Background

I'm a third year student at VIU, developing skills 
in data analysis, business intelligence, and statistical computing. I am an accounting major, though I began my university education at the University of Alberta studying computer science. I decided to move home and switch programs into business to follow in the footsteps of my grandfather whom I admire greatly. Outside of school I work on music through DAWs and plan to pursue that aspect of myself to the fullest extent upon completing my degree.
